Upon opening the page the user will be presented with a search option where they will enter in a city of their choosing.

After the user enters there city the page will utilize the Openweathermap API to pull the current forcast and a 5 day forcast letting the user know what the weather will be like throughout there week.
City's that the user searches for will be stored in local storage and displayed on the left had side of the screen. If a user clicks on one of these History Items it will replace the forcast on screen with the history item of their choosing. This allows the user to quickly and reliably see weather in their most traveled areas.
Once a city is selected it's UV index will also be displayed. This feature has a dynamically updated background that  gives a color gradient of lighter to darker depending on how high the index is. A snippet of information will display about this index level and give advice on how to properly protect yourself from the sun's rays. There will also be recommended protections depending on the UV index of that day allowingg users to have a quick glance on how they should prepare their day.

All selectable options will highlight and move when the user hovers over them allowing ease of access for everyone.




This quiz was built to showcase my API and js coding abilities by dynamically displaying items, logging information to local storage, Pulling information from an open source API, and allows for a custom user experience. This page uses 3 API calls to display a UV Index, current, and future weather data so users can plan their week accordingly.
